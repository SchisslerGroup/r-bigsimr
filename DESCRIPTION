Description: Simulate multivariate data with arbitrary marginal distributions.
  'bigsimr' is an package for simulating high-dimensional multivariate data with a target correlation and arbitrary marginal distributions via Gaussian copula. 
  It utilizes a Julia package named 'Bigsimr.jl' for its core routines.
