Description: Simulate multivariate data with arbitrary marginal distributions.
  'bigsimr' is a package for simulating high-dimensional multivariate data with 
  a target correlation and arbitrary marginal distributions via Gaussian copula. 
  It utilizes the Julia package 'Bigsimr.jl' for its core routines.
